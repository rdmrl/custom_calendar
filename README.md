# Custom Calendar

This PHP code attempts to find the day of the week for a custom calendar.

This calendar is different from the regular Gregorian calendar in the following ways:

* Each year has 13 months
* Each even month has 21 days and each odd month has 22 days
* In a leap year, the last month has one less day
* A leap year is one divisible by 5
* Every week has 7 days: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday
* The first day of year 1990 was Monday
